### Description

This app is being developed as a web project as part of an interview.  To be successful, my requirements are:  
1.  Develop a python-based RESTful web service using any off the shelf technology.  
2.  Develop a python-based RESTful web service using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).  
3.  Develop a python-based RESTful web service using [Inboard](https://github.com/br3ndonland/inboard).  
4.  Connect the web service to a database using any off the shelf technology.  
5.  Connect the web service to a database using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).  
6.  Contain the application usnig [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  
7.  Develop CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  

For my project, I decided to create an app that allows teachers to store lesson plans. It was a suggestion from my wife who's a high school teacher.  
So far, I have 1, 2, 4, and 5 met.

### Future Dev

1.  I currently only have one model in my database, because I decided to focus on technologies that I figured I'd have a harder time with. In the future I will add a User's table at the very least, and maybe some authentication.  
2.  The front end via templating using Jinja is basically a cut and paste of HTML code from w3schools. Cleaning up the front end and making it look nice is on the agenda, but for my MVP the templates will do.  
3.  Error catching and testing.  
4.  Model migrations using Alembic.  
5.  TBD
